# AI & ML Internship - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for **Task 2** of the AI & ML internship program. The objective was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships between variables.

I used the [Titanic Dataset](link-to-dataset-if-uploaded-or-source) for this task.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis

## EDA Highlights

- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Created histograms and boxplots to visualize distributions and detect outliers
- Plotted correlation matrix and pairplots to identify feature relationships
- Identified skewness and possible multicollinearity
- Drew basic inferences from visualizations

## Key Findings

- Example finding: "Age" had a relatively normal distribution.
- "Fare" showed positive skewness.
- Significant differences in survival rates based on gender/class were observed visually.

## Repository Structure

- `eda_analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with all EDA steps
- `titanic_dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` – This file has the information of basic statistics to understand survival patterns. This info is base on `titanic_dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
